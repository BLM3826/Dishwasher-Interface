# Dishwasher-Interface

This project was implemented for the 7th semester course "Human-Computer Interaction" of AUEB's undergraduate Informatics program.
We created a user interface for a dishwashing machine. The purpose was to simplify the process of washing one's dishes by offering them a simpler UI. To do this we had to create prototypes and do some surveys before starting to code. This helped us familiarize ourselves with other parts of software development cyrcle (except programming).

A video demonstrating our app in use is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZQi5DcARfY).

My partners in this project were Chrysa Dikonimaki ([@xrisaD](https://github.com/xrisaD)) and Vasilis Ballas ([@BLM3826](https://github.com/BLM3826)).
